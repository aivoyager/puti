    Tests the ethan-chat CLI in a way that allows debugging.

    This test invokes the CLI command directly within the test process,
    allowing you to set breakpoints in the CLI or agent code and step through it.
    It simulates a multi-turn conversation by feeding input to the command.

    Make sure TWIKIT_COOKIE_PATH is set correctly before running.

    To run this test:
        pytest test/puti/test_ehan_cli.py -v

    To debug this test in VSCode, set a breakpoint and run the test using
    the "Python: Debug Tests" command.
